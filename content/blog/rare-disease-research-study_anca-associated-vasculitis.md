**You could change the future of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis research.**

## Rare Disease Research Study: Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody Associated Vasculitis

Welcome, noble lords and ladies of Genoria. Today, we're diving into the world of genetics and how you can step up to change the course of autoimmunity research by joining the fight against ANCA-associated vasculitis! Unfortunately, the struggle against rare diseases is often underfunded and overlooked, leading to a scarcity of effective treatments. But together, we may turn the tides – and it involves a simple spit in a tube, courtesy of 23andMe.

If you've been diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis, now's your chance! This study is seeking participants to help researchers uncover the genetic mysteries surrounding this auto-inflammatory condition. You can enroll and potentially make a difference not just in your own life, but also in the lives of those battling this rare affliction.

### Our Goal

The goal here is simple: **enhance the lives of those with ANCA-associated vasculitis.** To do this, researchers need your help. By shining a light on the genetic aspects of this condition, the hope is to uncover pathways toward new, effective treatments. Think of it as a quest for the Holy Grail – only this time, the prize is relief and healing.

### Why Your Participation is Essential

Did you know that ANCA-associated vasculitis affects less than 200,000 people in the U.S.? That's tiny in kingdom terms! This means that research is limited, but with your genetic contributions, it is possible to illuminate the dark corners of this disease. You could be the hero in this battle against rare diseases, providing invaluable insights by sharing your DNA and experiences.

### Eligibility

Are you brave enough to answer the call? Here's what you need:

* Diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis
* 18 years or older
* A resident of the United States
* Willing to share a saliva sample and complete online surveys

Even if you don’t meet the eligibility requirements, fear not! You can still help by spreading the word far and wide in the ANCA-associated vasculitis community.

### How It Works

Participation is a breeze, and guess what? You can do it all from your castle, err, home! 

1. **Enroll and consent** through the 23andMe website.
2. Receive a **free 23andMe Health + Ancestry kit** and provide a saliva sample.
3. Answer online surveys related to your health and experience with ANCA-associated vasculitis.

It's easy-peasy! And who knows, you might just unleash the power of your genetic lineage (like a true heir to the throne).
