You might just hold the key to changing the future of essential thrombocythemia research. 

# Dive into Rare Disease Research: Essential Thrombocythemia

So, here’s the scoop: essential thrombocythemia (ET) is like that guest who shows up to a party uninvited and overstays their welcome—too many platelets flinging around in the bloodstream causing all sorts of ruckus. While ET may not be making headlines, it's definitely a thing researchers want to tackle. That's where the [23andMe Rare Disease Research Study](https://www.23andme.com/rare-disease-research-study/essential-thrombocythemia/) comes in. 

# Why Should You Care?

Because rare diseases like ET often suffer from a lack of funding and research support. But guess what? You, yes YOU, could be the hero in this story! By signing up, you can help 23andMe researchers learn more about the genetic nuances of people living with this condition, ultimately aiming to create effective treatments. 

## What's the Goal?

Simple: improve lives. 23andMe wants to put an end to ET’s mischief by gathering genetic and experiential data to carve a path for successful treatment. But without participants, this mission is like trying to build a castle without any bricks.

# Who Can Enter the Fray?

To step into this noble quest, you must meet the following criteria:

- Diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia
- 18 years or older (sorry, kiddos!)
- A resident of the U.S. (as much as we love the global fans, this study is currently U.S.-only)
- Willing to provide a saliva sample (so, no spitting contests, please!)
- Ready to complete online surveys about your health adventures

If you feel you can’t join but still want to champion the cause, share the news! You can help raise awareness and encourage others to participate. 

# How to Get Involved

The magic happens from home! Once eligible, you’ll receive a 23andMe Health + Ancestry kit at no cost. After you mail back your spit (classy, right?), you simply fill out online surveys about ET and your health.

# The Research Team: 23andMe

Founded on the idea that your DNA is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes (hence the name), 23andMe is your go-to squad for decoding the human genome. They take your genetic data and sprinkle in some science to possibly unlock new treatments. And by participating, you get a front-row seat in this groundbreaking journey.

## Remember the Fine Print

If you choose to join the ranks of genetic heroes, you’ll receive updates regarding the research’s progress. Your data will be kept private, and any identifying bits will be stripped away before they’re shared with other collaborators. 

Of course, all research comes with risks—data breaches and unknown surprises lurking in results. But rest assured, 23andMe does their utmost to ensure your data stays under wraps.

# Wrapping It Up

This is your chance to play a role in the essential thrombocythemia narrative. It’s time to transform that genetic information into knowledge, and maybe even treatments, that could enhance the lives of those battling ET. So why not grab that DNA kit, fill out some surveys, and march into the annals of science? 

Let’s turn those rare disease challenges into triumphant tales—join the 23andMe Rare Disease Research Study today!
