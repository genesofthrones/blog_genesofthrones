## How it works

Not everyone’s internal alarm clock rings at the same time. Some of us are ready to seize the day at the crack of dawn, while others would rather hit snooze for the hundredth time. Sounds a bit like a power struggle in House Helix, right? Well, as it turns out, your genes may be the ones deciding whether you're a chipper morning person or a grumpy night owl.

### The genetics behind wake-up time

Researchers at 23andMe have unveiled that our biological sleep rhythms might just be written in our DNA. They scoured 450 genetic markers that influence whether you're keen to rise with the sun or if you prefer to moonlight as a professional sleeper. Who knew your genes had such preferences?

### Did you know?

Some of the very genes that help set your sleep schedule are not just playing a one-dimensional game. These genes also influence your body temperature and hormone levels. So, if you're feeling like a total zombie during the day, your genetic makeup could indeed be the villain in your sleep saga.
