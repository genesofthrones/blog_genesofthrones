## Cheek Dimples: A Genetic Charm

Do cheek dimples remind you of a beloved cousin, nephew, or maybe your own baby pictures? Cheek dimples are those charming little indentations that add character to a smile. They're like nature's way of giving you a built-in companion for all your happiness-related selfies.

### How It Works

The “smiling muscle,” connected to each cheekbone and the corners of your mouth, plays a crucial role here. Some lucky folks have an extra "smiling muscle" in their cheeks, making those adorable dimples pop out whenever they flash their grins. Imagine that! We've been blessed—or cursed, depending on how you see it—with extra muscles for our emotional expressions. Who knew they'd come in handy for social media?

### The Genetic Link

For ages, people thought cheek dimples were just a genetic gift from one parent—a single dominant gene and poof, you’ve got dimples! Turns out, it’s a bit more complicated. According to research from [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/topics/traits/cheek-dimples/), at least **nine different genetic variants** are at play here. It’s like a genetic cocktail—who doesn’t love a mix?

### Did You Know?

Cheek dimples are more common in children than in adults—probably because kids have more adorable fat in their cheeks. As they grow up, they might lose that compelling smile accessory as their faces mature. So, if you've been wondering where your dimples went after your childhood—blame puberty!
