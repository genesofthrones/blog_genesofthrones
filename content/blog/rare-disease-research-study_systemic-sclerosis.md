You could change the future of systemic sclerosis research!
---------------------------------------------------------------

Ever heard of systemic sclerosis? No? Well, you've probably heard of scleroderma. Systemic sclerosis is a form of scleroderma that can wreak havoc not just on skin, but on internal organs as well. It's a big deal, especially because it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., making it one of those rare diseases that could use a little more love and attention.

This is where the **[23andMe Rare Disease Research Study](https://www.23andme.com/rare-disease-research-study/systemic-sclerosis/)** comes in. They're on a quest to find out more about the genetics of systemic sclerosis, and guess what? You can be part of it!

### Why Is This Important?

Rare diseases like systemic sclerosis often struggle for recognition. Think of it as the underdog of medical research. With limited funding, awareness, and treatment options, progress can be painfully slow. But by joining this study, you might just help pave the way for better treatments not just for yourself, but for everyone affected.

### What You Can Do

Wondering how to become part of this noble cause? It's easier than petitioning the throne in Genoria to let you into House Helix! Here’s a quick list of eligibility:

- You need to be diagnosed with systemic sclerosis.
- age 18 or older.
- Reside in the U.S.
- Willing to provide a saliva sample for a DNA test.
- Ready to complete some online surveys about your health and experiences.

If you don’t meet the criteria but still want to contribute, share the [flyer](https://permalinks.23andme.com/pdf/SS.pdf) to spread the word!
