## Lighten Up: Hair Photobleaching & Genetics

Ah, summer! The sun, the beach, and that irresistible urge to lighten up your hair with a little help from our friend, the sun. If you've ever wondered why some people come back from vacation rocking beachy highlights while you emerge from your sunbathing session with‚Äîwell, the same old hair, you might be interested in hair photobleaching and the genetics behind it.

### How It Works

So, here's the lowdown: photobleaching is what happens when your hair color lightens after being in the sun for a long time. If you're anything like me, you've probably tested the waters with lemon juice or a DIY sun-in spray to get that ‚ÄúI just spent a week in Hawaii‚Äù look. Well, it turns out that the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays not only tan our skin but also break down the pigment molecules in our hair. 

Researchers found that these rays have an impact on all hair types, but the extent of lightening varies. Basically, if you‚Äôre spending too much time in the sun, your hair is like, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm out!‚Äù and lightens up.

## The Genetic Link

Enter genetics. According to 23andMe scientists, they‚Äôve identified 48 genetic markers that could affect how your hair reacts to bright sunlight. While they still have a long way to go, it‚Äôs clear that genetics play a bit of a starring role in determining whether your hair will rock that sun-kissed look‚Äîor if it‚Äôll sulk in the shade.
