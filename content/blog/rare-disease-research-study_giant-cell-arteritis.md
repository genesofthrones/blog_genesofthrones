**You could change the future of giant cell arteritis research.**   

### Rare Disease Research Study: Giant Cell Arteritis

So you think your life is complex? Imagine having to deal with a rare disease like giant cell arteritis, an inflammation affecting arteries in the head, often right around the temples. It’s a pretty big deal and definitely no walk in the park. And guess what? There’s a lack of funding and awareness which makes it even more challenging to get new treatments approved. But here’s where we come in!

By participating in 23andMe’s research study on giant cell arteritis, you can help researchers get to the bottom of this mystery and potentially discover some effective treatments. Who knew you could be a superhero just by giving a bit of saliva and some survey answers from home?

### Why Your Participation Matters

Giant cell arteritis is rare—affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.—but your involvement can help shine a light on this issue. The 23andMe team aims to gather genetic information and personal insights from individuals living with the disease. Your journey could pave the way for advancements that benefit countless others!
