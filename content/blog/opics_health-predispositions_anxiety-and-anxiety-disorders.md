# Is Anxiety Genetic? Explore Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders, and what your DNA can tell you

**What are Anxiety Disorders?**
Everyone experiences anxiety at some point—like that feeling when you realize you’ve gone full Targaryen with your summer wardrobe. But when anxiety becomes so intense that it interferes with daily life, we're talking anxiety disorders. These are not just run-of-the-mill jitters; they include conditions like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and phobias.

**What are Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders?**
Each anxiety disorder comes with its unique set of symptoms, yet they all share that pesky feeling of fear and worry. Here’s a few classic signs that might sound too familiar:

- A pounding heart (not due to a drum solo)
- Hyperventilation (when you’re gasping like you just ran a marathon without training)
- Muscle tension (goodbye, casual Netflix binge!)
- Sweating (who needs a sauna when you can just panic?)
- Nausea and nightmares (there’s a reason they call it "anxiety dreams")
- Trouble sleeping (because who can sleep when there's a dragon on your mind?)

**Is Anxiety in Your Genes?**
Some people might be genetically wired to experience anxiety disorders. The catch? Genetics isn't the whole story. It’s a mix of genetic factors (like having certain variants lurking in your DNA) and non-genetic factors, like life’s rollercoaster—think stress, trauma, and more. 

Thanks to 23andMe, you can tap into over 7,700 genetic markers to check if you have an increased likelihood of anxiety. But remember, no single test can declare you "anxious" for life since so many variables are at play.

**Other Factors That May Cause Anxiety Disorders**
Even if your genes are chill, various other factors can jump into the mix. Example culprits include:

- A history of severe stress or trauma (like that time you saw your uncle dance at a wedding)
- Family history of anxiety (you might have inherited more than just great hair)
- Being female (ladies, the stats are against us here)
- Various health conditions (let’s keep it all in one pot)
