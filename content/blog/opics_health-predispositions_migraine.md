# Are Migraine Headaches Genetic? Explore Migraine Headaches and what your DNA can tell you

## What are migraine headaches?

Ah, migraines – that pesky condition that hits harder than a rogue bioengineer with a vendetta! Migraines are those moderate to severe headaches that don't just want to ruin your day; they also come with a package of sensory disturbances like flashes of lights or temporary blind spots (surprise!). And as a little bonus, they might throw in some nausea and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Fun, right?

## What are migraine triggers?

Now, on to the fun part: triggers! Certain lifestyle changes, weather shifts, or even your favorite horror movie might just send you spiraling into a migraine-induced fog. Common culprits include:

- Changes in sleeping or eating routines
- Stress (probably caused by avoiding those migraine triggers)
- Dehydration
- Certain foods and drinks (sorry, coffee lovers!)
- Odd odors, because your nose is not on your side that day

## Are migraines genetic?

While there's an entire realm of external factors at play, genetics seems to hold some cards in this migraine game. If you come from a lineage where migraines are as common as noble rivalries, your chances of developing them go up. 

Ever wondered about your genetic predisposition to migraines? Well, 23andMe has the answers! They offer a Migraine report through their **23andMe+ Premium** membership, where your DNA might reveal just how likely you are to embrace the migraine life.

### Did you know?

Interestingly, age and sex play a role too. Typically, migraines strike in youth, peaking during a person’s 30s (bad news for those in their thirties!) and tend to lessen in severity as you age. And hey, ladies, with hormonal changes playing a part in triggering migraines, you've got the unfortunate tendency to be more susceptible.

## Find out if your genetics might increase your likelihood of developing migraines

Curious to see if your genes betray your migraine fate? You can grab that Migraine report from 23andMe and get the lowdown on your genetic likelihood for a migraine membership experience. Remember though, this is not a medical diagnosis, just a friendly peek into your genetic makeup.

### Please note:

- It was developed using data from a treasure trove of willing participants. 
- Keep in mind this is just part of the genetic puzzle; lifestyle and family history matter too!
