Does this scenario sound familiar? You’ve just left a movie theater or a dimly-lit brunch spot, and you step out into blinding sunlight. Suddenly, your nose gets tickly—ah-ah-ah-choo! Yep, if this sounds like your day-to-day life, then you may possess the genetic trait known as the photic sneeze reflex. Yep. There's an actual scientific name for it: "Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst," or for the sake of brevity—and sanity—let’s just stick to "ACHOO Syndrome."

### How it Works
So, what’s going on here? When you step into bright sunshine, some people find themselves sneezing, and researchers are still scratching their heads over why. One theory is that bright light triggers a reflex, but we’re not entirely sure yet. Science takes time; *don’t rush it!*

### The Genetic Link
At one point, scientists thought this sneezing reflex stemmed from a single genetic variant passed down through families. However, it turns out that there are at least **54 genetic markers** involved—so much for the simple life! It seems we might need a PhD just to discuss our sneezing habits.

### Did You Know?
Sneezes can be surprisingly powerful! They can spray thousands of tiny droplets surprisingly far and fast—up to **two and a half feet** and at speeds reaching **12 mph**. So every time you sneeze at the sight of sunlight, you may be delivering a tiny shower of droplets. Gesundheit, indeed!

Think you might be a proud member of the ACHOO Syndrome club? Well, it’s time to embrace your sneeze-tastic identity with the help of the [23andMe Health + Ancestry Service](https://www.23andme.com/topics/traits/photic-sneeze-reflex/). Just pick up the kit, give a little spit (don’t worry, we know it sounds weird), and you’ll find out if your genetics are indeed the reason you’re lighting up the world one sneeze at a time.

### Genetic Insights for the Kingdom of Genoria
Speaking of genetic traits, let’s take a fantasy detour and imagine if our photic sneeze reflex existed in the kingdom of Genoria. People from House Genome might secretly flip their wigs over the fact that a simple sneeze is deeply linked to one’s ancestry. Meanwhile, House Mendel could be rushing to bioengineer a “no-sneeze-in-the-sun” potion, but let’s be real—some traditions are hard to break, even for rogue bioengineers!
