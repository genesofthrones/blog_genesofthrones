Ever wondered if you‚Äôre carrying any genetic variants that could cause inherited conditions? The **Carrier Status** tests provided by 23andMe can shine a light on this. These nifty tests check for genetic variants that are often specific to certain ethnicities and can inform you about your genetic makeup, helping you navigate the journey of building your family.

### Should You Speak to a Genetic Counselor?

Before diving headfirst into the genetic ocean, it‚Äôs wise to chat with a genetic counselor‚Äîa healthcare professional specializing in genetic conditions. They can answer all those burning questions you might have and help you find out whether testing is the right move for you. 

For those in Genoria (or elsewhere, really), take a moment to consult your healthcare provider or check out this helpful [link](https://www.bsgm.org.uk/public-patients-families/) to find a genetic clinic nearby.

![Counselor Questions](https://www.23andme.com/_next/static/media/genetic-counselor-graphic-cs.795d88e1.svg)

- What are the risks and benefits of testing for carrier status?
- What are you hoping to find out from genetic testing?
- Are there any diseases that run in your family?
- How do you handle potentially distressing information?

### What Do the Results Mean?

- **0 Variants**: üéâ You do not carry the variants tested. But don't rest on your laurels; there's still a chance that variants not covered by this test might be lurking in your genetics.
  
- **1 Variant**: ‚ö†Ô∏è You are a carrier! There‚Äôs a possibility you could pass that variant on to your kids. Family secrets revealed‚Äîsort of.

- **2 Variants**: üß¨ Uh-oh! You‚Äôre likely to pass a variant to your offspring. Better sit down with that genetic counselor!

- **Result Not Determined**: ü§∑ Your result didn‚Äôt come through clearly. Time to investigate further.

üí° Just to clarify, for some reports, having two copies of a variant means you‚Äôll definitely pass it on. Meanwhile, one copy may mean you're at risk for developing symptoms of the condition yourself.

### Have a Family History of a Genetic Condition? Planning to Have Kids?

If you're in the midst of family planning or have a family history of genetic conditions, it‚Äôs even more crucial to share your results with your doctor and discuss any further testing options. They can help you break down any potential risks and provide guidance for your future.

And while you‚Äôre at it, consider dishing out your findings to relatives. Trust me, they'll appreciate knowing their carrier status and any implications it might have!

As you navigate your genetic legacy, it's almost like being in a real-life episode of *Genes of Thrones*. Whether you're from House Helix, Mendel, Genome, or Cytos, understanding your genetic traits can make a significant difference.
