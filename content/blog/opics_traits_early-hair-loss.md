## The Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow Dilemma

Many folks invest a lot of time (and an even larger amount of money) into preserving their luscious locks. Let's be honest, some hairstyles are practically trophies of self-expression. So, when early hair loss strikes, it can feel like a thunderstorm on a sunshiny day. While environmental factors may play their part, scientists have uncovered an undeniable genetic connection to those disappearing strands. 

### How Early Hair Loss Works

We start life with about five million hair follicles, of which 100,000 to 150,000 are busily hanging out on our scalps. Over time, however, it seems our hair follicles get a little lazy—shrinking in size, producing thinner hairs, and eventually calling it quits. Talk about a slippery slope!

### The Genetic Link

Here's the kicker: the timing and intensity of hair thinning are heavily influenced by our genes. Researchers have identified various genetic variants in our DNA that can predispose us to early hair loss. So, it’s not just your dad's bald head you have to thank; a delightful combo of genetic variants from your folks can determine your follicle future.

### Did You Know?

Hair follicles that create longer hair enjoy longer growth phases. Eyebrow follicles are in and out in about 2-3 months, while scalp follicles can hang around in their growth phase for up to eight years. So, if your eyebrows look like they’re leaking out of your face while your scalp is going for a skinhead style, there you have it!
