## Step Forward and Contribute to Depression and Bipolar Research

Hey there, fellow genetic adventurers! üåü Are you between the ages of 18-50 and living in the U.S.? Do you have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder? If so, this might just be your chance to make a difference!

The **23andMe Depression and Bipolar Study** needs participants to help unravel the complex mysteries lurking in our DNA! Sounds fancy, right? But this is real research where your participation could help pave the way for better treatments and understanding of these conditions.

### Eligibility Criteria

You can be part of something bigger if you meet these guidelines:

- Diagnosed with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.
- Prescribed medication to treat either condition.
- Access to a desktop or laptop computer (no tablets or smartphones, sorry!).
- Willing to provide a saliva sample for DNA testing.
- Ready to complete online study sessions over nine months (simple surveys and cognitive tests).

So why is your help so important? Let's dive in!

## Why Your Help is So Important

Did you know that over **16 million Americans** are affected by depression, and nearly **6 million** have bipolar disorder? Despite this, many treatments don‚Äôt work for everyone. Researchers need to understand the unique genetic combos each individual brings to the table. That‚Äôs where you come in!

Your unique genetic information, combined with your personal experiences, could lead to breakthroughs in understanding these often-misunderstood conditions.

### The Big Picture

This study will analyze data from genetic tests alongside cognitive tests and surveys. By climbing into the genetic trove, researchers hope to learn just what makes our brains tick in relation to these disorders. And if you think about it, who wouldn't want to help science while binging on some quality time in front of a screen?

## What‚Äôs in it for You?

Not only will your participation potentially contribute to groundbreaking research, but you'll also get perks! If you‚Äôre new to **23andMe**, you‚Äôll receive **over 70 personalized genetic reports** about your health, ancestry, and even quirky traits. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to know if they‚Äôre genetically predisposed to liking pineapple on pizza? üççüçï 

Here‚Äôs what you can look forward to:

- **DNA Saliva Collection Kit** - Delivered right to your door, so you don‚Äôt have to figure out how to draw blood. Spoiler alert: no vampire visits required!
- **Monthly Online Study Sessions** - They‚Äôll send you some surveys and brain games with varied sessions to keep it interesting. Each session will take about **10-30 minutes** every month. We can all find 30 minutes in our calendars to save lives‚Äîeven my cat can spare that time from napping!
- **Understanding Your Genetic Makeup** - How cool is it to dive into what makes you, well, you? 

## Collaboration with Experts

23andMe is teaming up with the **Milken Institute** and **Lundbeck** to get this research rolling. Both organizations are in the business of understanding health and advancing medical discoveries‚Äîthink of them as the royal advisors in your genetic quest!

And yes, science papers link your familiar struggles with genes, much like how our heroes tackle a variety of foes in the showdown for the Iron Throne.

## Risks to Consider

With great power comes great responsibility, or in this case, with participating, comes potential emotional risks. The surveys can touch on sensitive topics. If the questions feel like they belong in a Cersei-approved interrogation chamber, just remember that it‚Äôs your journey, and it‚Äôs okay to skip or not answer anything that feels hard.

## Conclusion

So, if you're itching to contribute to significant research while getting to know yourself better through your genetic makeup, consider checking out the [23andMe Depression and Bipolar Study](https://www.23andme.com/depression-bipolar/). It‚Äôs basically an epic quest with mental health in mind, just without dragons and epic battles (unless your brain games get intense!).
