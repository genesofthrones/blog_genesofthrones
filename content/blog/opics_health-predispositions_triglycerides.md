## What are triglycerides?

If you’ve ever had an unexpected calorie binge (donuts, anyone?), your body kicks into gear and stores that excess energy in the form of triglycerides. So yes, those carbs you indulged in might be lounging around in your cells, waiting for a workout to kick them into action. Normal triglyceride levels are typically under 150 mg/dL. Over that threshold? Well, grab your sword because you might be battling health risks!

### The Impact of High Triglycerides on Your Health

Let's face it, nobody wants to be the house that gets hit with a heart disease siege. High triglycerides increase your risk for various heart-related issues, and they might even whisper sweet nothings to conditions like type 2 diabetes. They’re sneaky like that! The problem is, many people might not even realize they have high triglyceride levels until they get that dreaded blood test. 

If your levels are up, you might need to swap that chocolate cake for some broccoli. Your doc might recommend some lifestyle changes or even medications to help lower those pesky triglycerides.

### What Else Could Be Making Your Triglycerides Go Wild?

Aside from munching on too many snacks, there are other factors that may lead to higher triglyceride levels:

* Age (yes, getting older can raise those levels, so don’t blame it all on the cookies).
* Family history (thanks, genetics!).
* Pregnancy can cause a surprise spike in triglycerides.
* Conditions like type 2 diabetes or hypothyroidism.
* Medications—because sometimes pills come with unwanted side effects.
