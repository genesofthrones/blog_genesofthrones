# Let's Talk About Back Hair & Genetics

Summer's here! That time of year when some of us proudly embrace the fur on our backs like it's a trophy, while others are desperately seeking out their wax strips. Whatever your stance on back hair, one thing's for sure: your genetic code is the puppet master behind those follicles, deciding when and where hair decides to grow.

## How It Works

Here’s a quick lesson: hair follicles are like tiny production houses, each one cranking out a single strand of hair at a time. As hair cells do their thing from the bottom of the follicle, they’re helped along by handy proteins, like keratin, to form what we classify as "hair."

### The Genetic Link

Researchers at 23andMe have identified **17 genetic variants** tied to back hair. Why do some people have a lush back that rivals a chia pet while others are as bare as a dolphin? That’s still up for debate. Science, as always, is a work in progress!

### Fun Fact Time

Did you know we humans sport about **5 million hair follicles**? But most of our body hair is so fine and short it’s almost like it’s trying to hide! Evolutionaries believe that this relative hairlessness helped our ancient pals keep cool in scorching climates—and made hunting just a little less sweaty.
