# Hair Color Genetics: What Influences Your Hair Color? 

It may be trendy to dye your hair blue, purple, lavender, or pink and rock the “unicorn” or “mermaid” look, but the spectrum of natural hair colors is pretty impressive on its own. From blond to ebony, human hair creates a kaleidoscope of colors. How did you get your hair color? Your genes may have the answer.

## How it works

Our bodies produce a substance called pigment, and pigments are responsible for the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. When scientists talk about the pigments people produce, they’re generally referring to melanin. There are two types of melanin you should remember: eumelanin, which is brown/black, and pheomelanin, which is red/yellow. The lightness or darkness of your hair depends on the amount of these different types of melanin you produce. 

People with dark hair crank up the eumelanin production, while those with light hair produce less of it. And for those with some red hues, it’s all about how much pheomelanin you’ve got in the mix. Hair cells don’t make their own pigment, though; specialized skin cells called melanocytes within the hair follicle do that. So if your hair’s looking a little off, you might want to give your melanocytes a stern talking-to.

## The genetic link

So, you might be wondering if there’s a single gene that determines if your hair is blonde, brown, or black. Spoiler alert: There isn't! Instead, hundreds of genes are involved in the grand tapestry of hair color. In fact, some of the genes that affect hair color might also impact your eye color and skin pigmentation. Who knew your traits were so social?

## Did you know?

Your hair may change color at different points in your life naturally—without even touching a hair dye! Some locks can become a bit sun-kissed after too much time in the sun. That’s because UV rays can break down melanin in your hair. And then there are those pesky hormones; as kids hit puberty, their hair can surprise them by turning darker. If you're older, well, it's likely your hair will stop producing melanin entirely, and you’ll discover all those beautiful gray hairs that just love to pop up.
