Uh oh, whatâ€™s that rumble in your tummy? If you experience bloating, pain, and gas after indulging in a few too many lattes, you're not alone! Over 70 percent of adults worldwide have trouble digesting dairy products like milk, yogurt, cheese, and (cue sad trombone) ice cream. But fear not, in this epic saga of lactose intolerance, your genes may just hold the key!

## How It Works

Lactose is a sneaky sugar found in dairy products. Most babies are born with the superpower to digest lactoseâ€”thanks, Mom!â€”but as children grow and their diets expand, some of us stop producing lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. This can lead to a not-so-pleasant experience after enjoying a hefty helping of mac and cheese or a giant scoop of ice cream.

Hereâ€™s how the plot thickens (and so does your tummy): when someone who doesnâ€™t produce lactase munches on dairy, the bacteria in their gut decide to throw a lactose digestion party, producing gases that can lead to bloating and abdominal pain. Fun times, right?

## The Genetic Link

Your lactose drama can stem from a variety of factorsâ€”your diet, digestive system, and even your health conditions. But hereâ€™s where it gets really interesting: some folks are genetically predisposed to lactose intolerance. The LCT gene, perched comfortably on Chromosome 2, is responsible for making lactase. If your LCT gene is functioning like a well-oiled machine, you can enjoy dairy without distress.

However, if you have some specific genetic variants (thanks, ancestry!), your LCT gene might decide to take an extended vacation, leading to low lactase levels when you dive into dairy. So, if dairy leaves you sprinting to the nearest bathroom, your genes could be playing a role.

## Did You Know?

Not all cheese is created equal. If youâ€™re lactose intolerant and canâ€™t resist the creamy goodness of cheese, listen up! Some cheeses are lower in lactose than others. Next time you hit the grocery store, check the nutrition labels. If it says 0 grams of sugar, you may have a low-lactose friend on your hands. And aged cheeses are often magically lower in lactose, thanks to time working its charms.
