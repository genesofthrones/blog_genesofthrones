# Let's talk about Cilantro Taste Aversion

Disliking cilantro is more than just a taste preference. It turns out genetics may be involved.

* * *

Many people dislike cilantro (also known as coriander), describing the taste as “soapy.” 🤢 Researchers at 23andMe have found two genetic markers associated with this aversion. These markers are located near genes that help determine your sense of smell through **olfactory receptors**. Some of these receptors detect aldehydes, chemical compounds that are found in soap and thought to be a major component of cilantro aroma.

### What can make cilantro taste soapy?

There are two types of aldehydes thought to be responsible for cilantro aroma: one is described as smelling “fruity” and the other as “soapy.” Depending on which genetic variant you carry, your olfactory receptors may make cilantro taste like a delightful garnish—or a culinary crime.

### Genetic markers for cilantro taste aversion

Some genetic variants are linked with higher odds of disliking cilantro. So if your friend declares their undying love for the herb while you recoil in horror, it might just be in your genes! Overall, just 13% of 23andMe consented research participants think cilantro tastes “soapy.” So, you’re not alone in your cilantro trauma.

### Why Does This Matter?

Cilantro aversion is a fun little quirk, and while it may not deal with the throne disputes of Genoria, it connects to the bigger themes of genetics and how they impact our everyday lives. Understanding genetics doesn’t just help with flavor profiles; it also plays a pivotal role in the kind of powers noble houses in Genoria wield. 

Learning about your genetic makeup could give you insights into your own lineage—who knows what hidden traits might show up, perhaps even a potential knack for bioengineering like the members of House Mendel!
