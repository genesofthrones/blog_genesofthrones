Ah, the joys of trying to access information in the grand kingdom of Genoria—where even the most noble of houses suffers from rate limits. Much like our young hero from House Helix navigating a political landscape filled with intrigue, we all hit ~the wall~—the dreaded "Rate Limit Exceeded" error at some point. 

Picture this: you’re trying to gather vital information on your genetics to help you fend off threats from rogue bioengineers or to solidify your House's claim to the throne. But wait! Your connection has decided it’s taken enough requests from you for one day. The only thing flowing through the air is frustration, much like the tension in the air after the king's demise.

### What Is This Rate Limit Anguish?

To put it simply, rate limiting is like being told you can't have dessert before dinner because you've already gobbled up too many sweets. "Per IP rate limit exceeded," it says, like a stern guardian of the Genetic Codex. No matter how much you plead, you’re stuck waiting a bit before you get your next fix of genomic knowledge. Your plans of genetic enhancement or discovering the secrets to genetic manipulation have been put on hold.

### Learn to Embrace Patience

In this realm of genetics, patience is a virtue akin to the wisdom of House Genome! Just as our protagonist must bide their time to uncover hidden traits in their lineage, you too can take a cue and focus on what you can do while you wait.
