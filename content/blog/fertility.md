Hey there, brave souls of the fertile plains! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of genetics and fertility—you know, the sort of stuff that makes you rethink your family tree and your penchant for garden gnomes. If you’re a woman between the ages of 18-45, living in the United States, we’ve got an opportunity for you to join a research study with **23andMe**—and no, we aren't just asking for your favorite ice cream flavor!

## What’s the Deal?

If you think you might be pregnant or actively trying to conceive, you might just be the wise maiden or gallant knight we’re looking for! Whether you're gearing up for the next chapter in the realm of parenting, or if you recently embarked on the pregnancy quest in the last 12 months, your experiences could be crucial for this study. Plus, it’s a win-win situation because you’ll also snag some Amazon eGift Cards along the way! 🍭 

## What Do You Need to Join the Ranks?

- You must live in the U.S. (because roaming the kingdom of Genoria is a bit tricky without a proper address).
- If you have a male partner, he should not have any knights—er, procedures—that could interfere with conception (no vasectomies, testicular surgeries, or “erectile dysfunction” dragons permitted).
- Your own fertility journey should not include any surgical mishaps with your reproductive organs (sorry, but we need intact ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes).

## Why Join the Quest?

Because every journey to parenthood is as unique as the many legacies of House Helix, some women conceive right away, while others are left waiting in suspense. Did you know 1 in 8 women struggle with conceiving? This study aims to harness the power of genetics to help understand and possibly improve fertility potential. By participating, your DNA and survey responses can unlock insights that could lead to better diagnostics and treatments. Plus, you’ll be supporting a research study that aims to make a difference in fertility for many future generations.
