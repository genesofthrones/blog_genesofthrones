## How it works

Ever noticed your urine smells different after eating asparagus? You’re not alone—there’s actually some science behind that funky aroma!

### The genetic link

Researchers over at 23andMe have pinpointed a genetic marker near the OR2M7 gene that determines if you can smell that asparagus-related pee smell. This gene is like the bouncer at the door of your nose—it tells your body whether or not you get access to that particular odor.

### What causes the smell?

So, what’s the culprit behind that distinct smell? According to scientists, it’s the sulfur-containing molecules produced when your body breaks down asparagus. These are like tiny stink bombs going off in your system, sharing their essence with your bladder.

### Did you know?

Your nose is home to specialized nerve cells wrapped in molecular sensors known as “olfactory receptors.” These receptors are the real MVPs, helping humans recognize thousands of scents thanks to combinations of over 300 different olfactory receptors. The type of olfactory sensors you have essentially dictates what you can smell—so thank your parents for that!

### Why does this matter in Genoria?

Now, you might be thinking, “Asparagus and genetics, what gives?” Well, in the kingdom of Genoria, understanding your genetic traits and how they affect your unique abilities can mean the difference between ruling or being ruled. Whether enhancing your olfactory sense or figuring out if you’re more suited for House Genome’s analytical prowess, these discoveries can shift alliances and outlooks in the ongoing struggles for power.

In a world where genetics can dictate everything from your role in the family to how others perceive your capabilities, knowing your genetic strengths (or funky smells) could give you the upper hand.
