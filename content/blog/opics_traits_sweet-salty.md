Do you love saving room for dessert, or are you all about those pre-meal chips? It turns out your cravings for sweet or salty snacks are more than just personal taste — they might be coded in your DNA. Spoiler alert: genetics have a hand in your snack choices.

## How it works

Every time you take a bite (or sip), your taste buds send signals to your brain. This data travels to two major areas: the “primary gustatory cortex,” which helps identify the taste, and the “orbitofrontal cortex,” which lets you know if you like it or not. There's also some behind-the-scenes brain magic at play that tells you when to keep munching or when to put down the cookie.

### The genetic link

Curious how genetics determines your cravings? 23andMe's research has found **43 genetic markers** linked to whether you lean towards sweet treats or crave salty snacks. Some markers are tied to genes that help with brain function, while others connect to metabolism and body mass. Never underestimate how your genetic makeup can influence your snack game!

### Did you know?

Forget what you heard about taste receptors being confined to different parts of your tongue! Those receptors actually hang out all over your mouth. So, the next time someone tries to school you on tongue mapping, remember this not-so-secret fact!
