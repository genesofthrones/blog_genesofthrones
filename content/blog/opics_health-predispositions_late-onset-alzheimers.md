## What is Alzheimer’s disease and how common is it? 

Alzheimer’s disease, the notorious villain of memory loss, is a type of [dementia](https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/what-is-dementia). Its unwelcome guests include progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and some rather unexpected personality changes. 

The disease comes in two flavors: late-onset and early-onset. Late-onset Alzheimer’s is like that annoying relative that shows up uninvited after age 65, while early-onset barges in far too early, often in one’s 30s, 40s, or 50s (talk about bad timing!). 

Now, it turns out that some genetic traits, particularly the ε4 variant of the _A P O E_ gene, can increase your chances of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s. While genetics play a role in this saga, they're not the whole story.

### Typical signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease:

- Memory loss that gets worse with time (no, it’s not just because you forgot where you put your keys)
- Mood and personality changes (who's this grumpy person?)
- Trouble planning or solving problems (making dinner now seems like rocket science)
- Confusion about time and place (where did I park? Oh wait, what day is it?)
- Difficulty with everyday activities (showering becomes a monumental task)

Alzheimer’s affects people of all backgrounds, but some groups, like elderly African Americans and Hispanic/Latin Americans, are even more likely to experience its effects.

## What causes Alzheimer’s disease?

Alzheimer’s has more than one cause. Sure, genetics can play the guilty party, especially when it comes to early-onset. Families with a strong genetic history may pass down this unwelcome inheritance through what's known as [autosomal dominant inheritance](https://dian.wustl.edu/)—meaning if one parent’s got it, their child has a 50% chance of inheriting it too. 

But wait! There's more! Non-genetic factors like age, exercise, diet, and keeping your brain busy can also affect the risk. Surprisingly, research by 23andMe has shown that adults over 60 who average at least 30 minutes of exercise per week have a lower likelihood of Alzheimer’s, whether they carry that pesky ε4 variant or not. So get moving!

## Does Alzheimer’s disease run in families?

Yes, it can! If you’ve got a family history of Alzheimer’s, you might want to keep an eye out. While you can't hit fast-forward and skip this particular family trait, having a genetic counselor discuss genetic testing options is a smart move. 

And speaking of genetic testing, if you're curious—or maybe a little apprehensive—about your chances of dancing with Alzheimer’s, services like [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/membership/) provide the opportunity to check for those genetic variants linked to the disease.

## Can genetic testing tell me if I am at risk for Alzheimer’s disease? 

The short answer: kind of! Genetic testing can pinpoint whether you have certain markers that may increase your risk. 23andMe uses genotyping to detect if you have the ε4 variant in the _A P O E_ gene linked to late-onset Alzheimer’s. 

However, having this variant doesn’t seal your fate. It's like knowing your cousin once got a speeding ticket—it’s a risk, but you might not be on the same path.

## How can I reduce my risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease?

Although there's no magic cure to Alzheimer's yet, there are steps you can take to keep the chances at bay:

- **Diet**: Load up on green leafy veggies, fruits, whole grains, and heart-healthy fats. 
- **Intellectual Activities**: Engage your brain with puzzles, reading, or other mentally stimulating tasks.
- **Exercise**: We already know this is good for the brain. So lace up those sneakers and move your feet!
- **Heart Health**: Keep your blood pressure in check. Good heart health is good brain health.

## Can knowing that I have the ε4 genetic variant tell me anything else about my health?

Most definitely! Research is revealing that people with the ε4 variant may have associations with lipid levels in the blood. Think of it as a two-for-one special—learning about your Alzheimer's risk could also provide insights into your heart health. 

## Final Thoughts

While the Kingdom of Genoria may wrestle with genetic conflicts, the real-life struggle against Alzheimer's offers us a different kind of challenge. If you suspect you might have hereditary traits leading you down this path, consider checking out [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/app-store) and uncover how your own genetics might play into your health narrative. Just remember, knowledge is power—especially when it comes to your health!
