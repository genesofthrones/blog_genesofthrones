## Rare Disease Research Study: Myelodysplastic Syndrome

Myelodysplastic syndrome sounds fancy, but it’s basically a group of disorders where your blood cells decide to ignore the rules of formation and function. Yeah, not ideal. This is just one of several rare diseases under the microscope thanks to 23andMe’s Rare Disease Research Study. The funding struggles and lack of awareness around such diseases often keep new treatments rarer than a unicorn in a pet store. But change is possible! By participating, you could help move the needle toward better treatments for people with this condition.

So, what’s the catch? There isn’t one! Your participation could lead to research breakthroughs, and wouldn't it be cool to say you were a part of changing someone's life for the better?

### Our Goal

Our mission is straightforward: improve the lives of those grappling with myelodysplastic syndrome by developing effective treatments. Your input can help us reach this vital goal. 

### Why Your Participation Matters

Myelodysplastic syndrome isn't exactly a crowd favorite—it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Think of it as the introvert of the disease world. But together, we can shine some light on it! By providing genetic info and personal insights, you can potentially fast-track treatment discoveries. So, why not give it a go?

### Eligibility

Here’s who we’re looking for to join the party:

* Diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome
* 18 years old or older
* U.S. resident
* Ready to spit in a tube (saliva sample for DNA testing)
* Willing to complete some online surveys about your health experience

And hey, if you don’t fit the bill but still want to help, share our [flyer](https://permalinks.23andme.com/pdf/MDS.pdf) with your fellow myelodysplastic syndrome warriors!

### How It Works

Participating is a breeze, and you can do it in your PJs! If you’re eligible, you’ll receive a 23andMe Health + Ancestry kit free of charge. After providing your saliva sample, just sit back and complete a couple of online surveys about your health and experience with myelodysplastic syndrome.

Wondering what else 23andMe offers? You can check out their [Health + Ancestry Service](https://www.23andme.com/dna-health-ancestry/). They have that down to a science!

### Who We Are

23andMe has been at the forefront of genetic innovation since 2006. The name refers to our 23 pairs of chromosomes—yes, that’s what you’re made of! We aim to empower everyone to not just understand but also leverage the human genome for personal and collective improvement. By bringing together the community, we believe we can get closer to groundbreaking discoveries with genetic data.

### The Fun Part (FAQs and Resources)

Got questions? Pop over to our [Rare Disease Research Study page](https://www.23andme.com/rare-disease-research-study/) for all the nitty-gritty details. You’ll find info about how genetics plays a role in rare diseases, and maybe you’ll discover that you can add ‘genetic researcher’ to your resume.
