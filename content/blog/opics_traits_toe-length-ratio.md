Let's talk about Toe Length Ratio & Genetics
-------------------------------------------

Have you ever glanced down at your feet and wondered why your big toe is longer than your second toe, or the other way around? Spoiler alert: your DNA may be the culprit! 

### How it works

Some toe length ratios can feel like a genetic family feud. Is it a classic case of “Big Toe vs. Second Toe”? It turns out the answer may lie in the great hormonal soap opera that occurs in the womb during early pregnancy. Levels of testosterone and estrogen hanging around can influence whether you sprout a longer big toe or a second toe that takes the crown.

Harrison measured toes of ancient skeletons and mummies - let's just say he had quite the toe-tally cool job!
