## What is a bunion?

A bunion is that annoying little bony bump on your big toe that can sometimes feel like it's got a personal vendetta against your footwear. For some lucky souls, bunions are just an aesthetic concern, but for others, they can bring a whole world of pain. If you've got them or suspect you might be getting them, fear not. You're not alone!

## What causes bunions?

So why do some people sport bunions while others have perfectly aligned piggies? Usually, it’s all about the big toe deciding it wants to make new friends with its neighbor. This drift can create that unmistakable bump, leading to possible pain or discomfort. 

While it may feel like your foot is plotting against you, the reasons behind bunion formation can be a bit complicated. A combo of genetics and footwear choices—yes, those cute but impractical shoes—are often to blame. Think of it like a team effort: shoes contribute to the problem, but some legs of the genetic family tree might be taking the lead.
