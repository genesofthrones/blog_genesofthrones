If you've always thought mosquitoes have a personal vendetta against you while your friends remain bite-free, you're not alone. Turns out, mosquitoes can be little judgmental pests when it comes to choosing their victims, and guess what? Your genes might shine a light on this bizarre preference!

## How It Works

As annoying as they are, mosquitoes are not just randomly picking their favorites; they have a method to their madness. They're drawn to the breath we exhale and the aroma of our body odor, especially that lovely scent wafting from our sweat glands. Cue the eye roll! According to researchers at 23andMe, your genetic makeup partially determines how often you get bitten (thanks, genetics!). 

### The Genetic Link

In an interesting twist, 23andMe scientists have pinpointed **285 genetic markers** that correlate with how frequently you're bitten by those pesky flying nuisances. It’s a whole genetic buffet of bite frequency, bite itchiness, and even bite size. Alongside these genetic quirks, factors like age and sex also play a role in whether you become the mosquito's chosen one.

### Did You Know?

A whopping **37.5%** of 23andMe participants admit that mosquitoes seem to have a special affinity for them. In contrast, only **27.5%** reported being the less desirable target. So next time your friends are flaunting their bite-free skin, you can confidently blame your genetic profile!
