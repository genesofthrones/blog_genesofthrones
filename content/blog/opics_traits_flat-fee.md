### What’s the scoop on flat feet? 

Let’s walk through it together. Spoiler alert: It’s not as comfortable as it sounds.

### What causes flat feet?

Flat feet occur when the raised structure on the inside of the foot, the medial arch, is lower than a disappointed child’s expectations on Christmas morning. This is very common in children when the medial arch is still figuring itself out. By adolescence, most arches become fully formed. However, for some, the arch may never reach its peak or may choose to collapse when life gets too serious—or is it just poorly designed shoes?

### Are flat feet genetic?

Absolutely! Scientists at 23andMe think so too. They discovered that Uncle Larry and Aunt Martha might not be the only reason you’ve got feet like a platypus; genetics play a role! Research indicates that injury, obesity, and certain health conditions might also throw their hats into the ring. It’s a party down there, but flat feet might not be the guest you wanted.
