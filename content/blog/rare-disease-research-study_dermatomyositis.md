Have you ever wondered if your genes could change the world? Well, here’s your chance! 

## Rare Disease Research Study: Dermatomyositis

Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory disease that brings muscle weakness and a snazzy skin rash along for the ride. It's like the grumpy relative at a family reunion—you probably don’t want them there, but they sure are hard to get rid of! Unfortunately, rare diseases like dermatomyositis don't get the attention they deserve when it comes to funding and research. That’s where the 23andMe Rare Disease Research Study kicks in. They're on a mission to decode the genetic mysteries of dermatomyositis, so we can develop better treatments and improve lives.

### Our Goal

The plan is straightforward: To improve the lives of those with dermatomyositis and develop effective treatments through research. Seems simple enough, right? But the research relies on YOU to provide genetic data and personal insights!

### Why Your Participation Matters

Since dermatomyositis affects less than 200,000 people in the U.S., it’s often overlooked. Putting together a community of participants willing to share genetic information and personal experiences is crucial in shedding light on this rare disease. By participating, you could jumpstart the research and potentially help yourself and others.

### Eligibility

Wondering if you can join in? Check if you meet the following criteria:

- Diagnosed with dermatomyositis
- 18 years or older
- Living in the U.S. (sorry, not available in the Seven Kingdoms yet)
- Willing to provide a saliva sample for DNA analysis
- Open to completing online surveys regarding your experience 

Not eligible? No worries! You can help simply by sharing the word with your dermatomyositis community using this [flyer](https://permalinks.23andme.com/pdf/DM.pdf).

### How It Works

Getting involved is as easy as pie. If eligible, you’ll receive a free 23andMe Health + Ancestry kit! Just provide a saliva sample and complete a couple of online surveys, and you’re good to go. You can do all of this from the comfort of your home—pajamas encouraged!

Learn more about the [23andMe Health + Ancestry Service](https://www.23andme.com/dna-health-ancestry/) and read about [important test information](https://www.23andme.com/test-info/) to get started!

### About 23andMe

Founded with the mission to help people access, understand, and benefit from the human genome, 23andMe is all about community. They’ve made it possible for individuals to contribute genetics data for research in a secure and protected way.

This brings us to the big question: how do the characters from Genoria fit into this newfound world of genetics? Well, House Mendel might be the perfect ally for this. Imagine what secrets they could unlock with their legendary knowledge of genetic manipulation! If only they had some data from the 23andMe study—they could craft potent alliances to claim the upper hand in the royal squabbles. 

### FAQs and Resources

Got questions? Here’s a helpful FAQ section, or you can shoot an email over to [rare-disease@23andme.com](mailto:rare-disease@23andme.com). 

Furthermore, if you want to learn more about personal genomics and explore even more exciting apps, check out the [GenePlaza App Store](https://www.GenePlaza.com/app-store). You might just find an app that helps unlock the secrets of your own genetic heritage—because who doesn’t want to know if they’re actually related to a hidden royal ancestor?

Now, let’s change the world (and maybe our skin conditions) together with science, a sprinkle of humor, and a good dose of genetic data!
