Have you ever looked down from a tall building and thought, "Why did I think coming up here was a good idea?" If you find yourself trembling at the thought of rock climbing or zip lining, you might want to blame your ancestors instead of your breakfast burrito. According to research from 23andMe, genetics could have a big role in how we react to heights.

## How It Works

Let's talk science! When you're standing upright, your brain is constantly getting updates from the objects around you to help keep your balance. But throw in a high elevation, like the edge of a skyscraper, and your brain is suddenly like a bad GPS—lost and confused. With everything way out there, your brain has a tough time figuring out how to maintain that balance you've been taking for granted. So if you're feeling a bit shaky, it might not just be fear; it's your biology having a meltdown.

### The Genetic Link

Here’s where it gets interesting: 23andMe identified **392 genetic markers** associated with that good ol' fear of heights. They paired these genetic indicators with non-genetic factors such as age and sex to whip up a statistical magic trick that predicts your chances of fear, climbing up there alongside your grandma at family gatherings.

### Did You Know?

From their research, it turns out an average 23andMe participant has about a **29% chance** of being afraid of heights. Now you can feel a little better when you're clutching the railing, knowing genetics might be to blame.
