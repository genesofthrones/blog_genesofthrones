Ever find yourself confused about those midnight twitches? You’re not alone! Turns out, twitching doesn't always mean you're in the middle of a nightmare involving dragons and lost kingdoms. In fact, the science behind sleep movement—particularly the involuntary limb twitches known as periodic limb movements (PLMs)—is linked to genetics, baby!

## The Science of Sleep Movement

During your nightly hibernation, you might not realize what your body is up to. According to sleep studies, the average person moves about **13 times per hour**—but that figure can vary wildly. Some folks barely budge, while others could put a wriggly puppy to shame, moving over **100 times per hour**. Talk about a dance party!

### The Genetic Link

Hold onto your pillows! Scientists have identified a sneaky little genetic marker in the **BTBD9** gene that influences how much people twitch. There are two versions of this gene: the **A variant** and the **G variant**. If you've got more A variants than G variants, get ready for some extra legwork in your sleep—those A variants can lead to an additional **4-5 movements per hour**, compared to the G squad!
