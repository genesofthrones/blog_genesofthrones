## What is Familial Hypercholesterolemia and How Common Is It?

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic condition where cholesterol ranges are not just a matter of your last pizza slice. We're talking about extremely high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), commonly referred to as "bad" cholesterol. If you've ever heard of high cholesterol leading to early cardiovascular diseases, FH takes the cake—or should I say, the cholesterol-laden pie? It increases the risk of heart attacks significantly.

To break it down: 
- “Familial" indicates that FH can run in families (because what doesn’t, really?).
- “Hypercholesterolemia” literally means “high levels of cholesterol in the blood.” So, no mystery here!

It's estimated that **one in 250** people worldwide have FH, and shockingly, about **70%** of those folks don't even know it. And it doesn't favor one sex over the other—it loves everyone equally. 

### Symptoms? Or Just Bad Cholesterol Levels?

Symptoms can be quite sneaky; they might show up as high cholesterol levels, chest pain, or even "Hey, why do you have those weird fat deposits around your eyes?" Some people might only find out they have FH after going through a heart attack—a pretty rude awakening.

### Risk by Gender

Both men and women have a **50% chance** of inheriting this pesky genetic variant from a parent with FH. However, if untreated, men have a **50% chance of having a heart attack by age 50**, while women have a **30% chance by age 60**. So, there's a silver lining for women—unless you’ve just hit the menopause rollercoaster!

### Ancestry and FH

FH does like to play favorites. Some variants are more prevalent in certain ancestral groups, such as those of European or Lebanese descent. However, it doesn't discriminate and can affect people from various backgrounds.

## What Causes Familial Hypercholesterolemia?

The driving force behind FH is genetics, with some lifestyle factors thrown into the mix. Our LDL cholesterol levels are like guests at a party—some come and leave as they please. But for those with FH, the bouncers (the liver's LDL receptors) aren’t very effective, which leaves too many guests (LDL molecules) lingering in the bloodstream. If the levels spiral too high, it can lead to cardiovascular diseases.

### The Genetic Hall of Fame (or Shame?)

The main culprits (genes, not people) behind FH include:
- **APOB:** This gene helps LDL cholesterol bind to various receptors. Variants here make you a less-than-successful bouncer.
- **LDLR:** This gene does the heavy lifting, moving LDL cholesterol to the liver for disposal. Variants here further exacerbate the problem.

## Genetic Testing for Familial Hypercholesterolemia

Now, this is where things get intriguing. **Genetic testing** can reveal if you have a variant linked to FH. For those already carrying the familial hypercholesterolemia curse, knowing sooner means better action plans… like starting cholesterol-lowering medications early.

23andMe offers a **Familial Hypercholesterolemia Genetic Health Risk report** that tests for **24 genetic variants**. Talk about putting the “fun” in functional genetics!

### What to Do If You Find Out You Have FH

First things first, don’t freak out. Discovering you have an FH variant doesn’t mean you’re doomed. The next step is chatting with a healthcare provider who knows their way around FH. Effective treatments exist, ranging from dietary changes to medications like statins. 

But why stop there? Almost like a side quest in our Genoria saga, there are also newer treatments in trials that might be on the horizon for FH.

## The Moral of the Story: Genetic Knowledge is Power

Just like in the kingdom of Genoria, where the Genetic Codex holds the secrets to power and health, understanding your genetics can unlock keys to longevity. Take charge of your knowledge and explore your genetics using helpful resources like [23andMe](https://www.GenePlaza.com/app-store) to better your health future.

I mean, if you had the chance to uncover family traits—not just the ones that make you cringe at holiday dinners—wouldn't you take it?

So before you pop that cheeseburger, perhaps consider checking in with your SNPs. After all, genetic wisdom just might save your heart.
