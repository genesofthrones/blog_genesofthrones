Ah, the royal kingdom of Genoria—where the noble houses battle it out for supremacy based on their dazzling grasp of genetics. One would think that in a world where heroes exploit genetic prowess, there wouldn’t be such pesky things as “rate limits,” right? Well, my friends, even in a land fortified by genetic manipulation, it seems that nothing is safe from annoying bureaucratic barriers.

Imagine our protagonist from House Helix, who has discovered a hidden genetic trait—the ability to, say, run marathons while juggling dragons! Sounds awesome, right? But just as they prepare for the ultimate race, a mysterious message appears: *“Rate limit exceeded. CRAWL 20 times since Thu May 16, 2024.”*

### Confounded by Limits

What is this sorcery? Our hero can outpace a stallion, yet they’re restricted by some invisible rule like a common dev. It seems not even their genetic ingenuity could save them from a message that reads, *“Per IP rate limit exceeded.”*

You see, as powerful as genetic traits can be, they often need room to breathe, much like the fresh air in the valley of House Genome. No one wants to be that noble who turns into a pumpkin at midnight because they overstepped their bounds—either in a race or by requesting too much dragon-juice from the Very Important Potion Vendor.

### Enter the GenePlaza App Store
