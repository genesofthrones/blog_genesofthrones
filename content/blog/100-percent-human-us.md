At 23andMe, they like to remind us that, despite the diversity in our ethnic backgrounds, we're far more alike than we might think—like 99.5% similar! Yes, you heard that right! Imagine that—your great uncle Bob from the Thanksgiving dinner table isn’t as different as you think from that refugee you're serving soup to at the local shelter.

Today, on World Refugee Day, 23andMe is teaming up with a great cause—the International Rescue Committee (IRC). This organization has dedicated itself to helping displaced people around the world find their footing in an uncertain future. It’s like giving someone a new pair of shoes after they’ve been running through mud for so long—only it’s a lot more complicated than a simple shoe donation.

So, what does DNA have to do with human rights? Well, let’s just say that 23andMe believes that our genetic connections could be the key to unlocking empathy and understanding. This initiative is about recognizing our common humanity and advocating for every individual’s right to live a life that’s safe, healthy, and productive. And doesn't everyone deserve a chance to strut their stuff in a world that affords them respect and compassion? I mean, Bob might be a bit cranky, but he's still family, right?

What makes this mission even cooler is considering how personal genomics can help us all rethink our values. Think of it as the ultimate family reunion! Whether you're from the noble House Helix with those enviable genes or just your average Joe (or Jane) from any house, our shared genetic history could become a driving force for change in the world.

And hey, if you want to dig deeper into your own genetic makeup (and maybe uncover some hidden talents or traits), check out the **[GenePlaza App Store](https://www.GenePlaza.com/app-store)**. There are several apps available that can shed light on the amazing ways your genetics influence your life—just remember, no matter what your genes say, you’re still fabulous and deserving of compassion!

So, as we reflect on significant issues like refugee rights, let’s also remember that we all share a little something special in our DNA that connects us. 

Here's to using our genetic commonalities to stand up for what’s right and ensuring everyone gets a seat at the table (or at least a warm bowl of soup)!

Keep it human,
