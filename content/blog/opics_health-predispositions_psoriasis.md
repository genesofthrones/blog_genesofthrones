## What is psoriasis?

Psoriasis is not just the annoying skin condition that your weird uncle talks about at family gatherings. It's a chronic autoimmune issue that significantly affects people's lives. Imagine your skin working overtime, producing new cells faster than a cat on catnip, leading to those characteristic itchy, scaly patches. These patches—called plaques—prefer to hang out on your knees, elbows, trunk, and scalp. They come and go like your motivation to go to the gym, but some folks experience these flare-ups triggered by various factors.

So no, psoriasis is not an infection, and you won't catch it from sharing a bowl of nachos.

## What are psoriasis triggers?

Some people might assume that stress is the main workhorse behind psoriasis flare-ups. While stress is a significant player, a variety of other factors can also trigger it, including:

* **Skin Injuries:** Scratches, bug bites, or even sunburns may light the fires of a flare-up.
* **Illness or Infection:** If your immune system is down, so can your skin.
* **Alcohol and Tobacco:** These can contribute to flare-ups like that one friend who shows up at the party without an invitation.
* **Weather:** Cold, dry conditions can be as unpleasant as your ex showing up unexpectedly.

Since triggers can vary among individuals, keeping a diary to track your symptoms could be more valuable than any fortune teller’s crystal ball.

## How can psoriasis impact your health?

While the skin is where psoriasis shows up most obviously, it can also come bearing some not-so-fun side effects for your health. Individuals with psoriasis may be at a higher risk for other conditions, such as:

* **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A painful friend that no one wants to meet.
* **High Blood Pressure and Heart Disease:** You really don’t want these crashers at your wellness party.
* **Mental Health:** The condition could lead to feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem—like trying to pull off last year's trends.

So while it’s essential to focus on the skin, it might be worth chatting with a healthcare professional about the broader implications on your health.

## Is psoriasis genetic?

Of course! Like your affection for pizza, your likelihood of developing psoriasis may run in the family. If one of your parents has it, treat this like a “choose your own adventure” story—you might have a higher chance of experiencing it too. Scientists suggest that it takes a combination of various genetic markers (more than 7,500 of them!) to elevate your odds of developing psoriasis.

And while genetics are important, don't ignore the lifestyle factors and family history that could also play a role. Genes alone won't write your entire destiny—think of them as part of a bigger story.

## Find out if your genetics might increase your likelihood of developing psoriasis

If you’re scratching your head (but not literally) wondering whether you might have an increased chance of developing psoriasis, the **Psoriasis report** by 23andMe can help you unravel those genetic threads. A part of their 23andMe+ Premium membership, this report offers deep dives into health and ancestry, helping you understand your genetic compatibility with psoriasis.

## Important Note...
This report doesn't diagnose you, so don’t plan your skincare regime just yet. It's merely a glimpse into your genetic likelihood based on research from other customers. Keep in mind that lifestyle and family history also play critical roles.
