## Is AAT Deficiency Genetic?

Yes, indeed! Just like the quirky family traits passed down from your great-uncle Lenny (you know, the one with the mustache and that peculiar dance move), AAT deficiency is caused by genetic variants in the SERPINA1 gene. This gene lays down the law for making a very important protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Your liver is a hard worker, producing AAT, which then heads over to your lungs to protect them from potential damage.

But here's the kicker — if you have certain variants in the SERPINA1 gene, your body can end up producing too little AAT, leaving your lungs feeling like they forgot their raincoat at home. Too much AAT can get stuck in the liver, leading to all sorts of trouble there too.

### AAT Deficiency: It’s Not Just Genetics

While genetics might be to blame, it’s not the only player in this game. Lifestyle choices, your environment, and maybe even that spicy taco you had last week can impact whether someone with AAT deficiency develops lung or liver issues. For instance, smoking can speed up lung problems while drinking way too much alcohol could put your liver in a tough spot.

Consulting with a healthcare professional is always a smart choice before you start swapping fried food for salad. 

### The Hush-Hush Disease

What's wild is that many folks living with AAT deficiency don’t even know it. Yup, this crafty condition has managed to stay under the radar, with fewer than 10% of affected individuals receiving an official diagnosis. Talk about a sneaky ninja!

### Unraveling Your Genetic Story

If you’re curious about your own genetic makeup and whether you might be at risk for this condition, the 23andMe Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Genetic Health Risk report is like a revealing family photo album of your genes. This nifty report checks for two key genetic variants from your SERPINA1 gene that are commonly linked to AAT deficiency. It’s like being at a family reunion and discovering that there’s more to your genetics than you thought.

### The 23andMe Advantage

Just a heads-up though, while the 23andMe PGS test offers valuable insights, it’s important to remember that it’s not a diagnosis, just a sneak peek at what your genes might say about your health. Additionally, factors like your ethnicity can influence how those genetic health risk results are interpreted. The report focuses specifically on the PI*Z and PI*S variants in the SERPINA1 gene which are the most common ones tied to AAT deficiency.

Make sure to do your homework and consult a healthcare professional on your findings — you wouldn’t want to run off thinking you’re destined to become the next chosen one without the necessary intel!
