# Let's Talk About Cleft Chin & Genetics

What is a cleft chin? This facial feature forms an indentation or dimple in the chin and occurs in both women and men.

## How It Works

When your chin is forming, the left and right halves of the lower jaw start as two bones that join in infancy. But if you have a cleft chin, your jawbone might still have a little gap in the middle. Think of it as the chin saying, "Why fit in when you can stand out?"

### The Genetic Link

So far, researchers have identified **38 genetic markers** that may affect whether or not you have a cleft chin. Many of these markers are located in or near genes that influence facial bone and skull growth. Those markers must be working overtime if your chin is more famous than you are!

### Did You Know?

Some researchers think our early ancestors developed chins after they began cooking with fire around a million years ago. Cooking made food softer and easier to chew, which meant losing some of our larger teeth and mouths. The bottom of the jawbone didn‚Äôt shrink as much, leaving us with a chin that sticks out from the rest of the face. So, thanks, fire!
