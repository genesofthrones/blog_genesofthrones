## Through Thick and Thin: Hair Thickness & Genetics

By now, you might already know whether you have thick hair. Maybe you've been known to snap a brush handle or two when pulling it through your hair. But did you know that individual hair strands come in different sizes, and some people have thicker strands than others? Through thick and thin, your genes influence hundreds of your traits, and hair thickness is one of them.

### How it Works

Hair follicles come in different shapes and sizes, affecting hair texture and width. Some folks have wider follicles—and therefore thicker hair strands—than others. While genetics are a major player in whether your hair looks like a luscious lion's mane or more like a bedraggled broom, don’t forget that hormones and age are also tossing their hats into the ring.

### The Genetic Link

So, what causes the differences in our precious follicles? Science suggests that there are many genes at play, but one of the heavy hitters is the **EDAR** gene, which influences hair follicle development. You might say that the EDAR gene is the star player in the Hair Thickness Championship!

### Did You Know?

If you're of East Asian descent, you'll likely find that you have thicker strands of hair compared to your friends of African or European descent. Think of it as a hair-related game of genetics, where some players are just naturally winning!

### Explore More
