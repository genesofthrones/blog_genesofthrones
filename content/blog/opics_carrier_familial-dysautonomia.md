Let's talk about Familial Dysautonomia
-------------------------------------

Familial dysautonomia might sound like a spell from a wizarding world, but it’s actually a rare genetic disorder with some serious implications. Individuals affected by this condition deal with various dysfunctions across their nervous system, impacting movement, senses, and those sneaky involuntary functions we usually take for granted, like breathing or your heart beating (thanks, brain!).

### The genetics behind familial dysautonomia

So, here's the scoop: familial dysautonomia is caused by variants in the ELP1 gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein (let's call it ELP1 because we're friends now) that’s crucial for reading genetic info—especially that needed for cell movement and structure. When there are certain variants in the ELP1 gene, the production of ELP1 gets a little shy, especially in the brain. 

To have familial dysautonomia, you need to land two unfortunate variants in your ELP1 gene. If you've only got one variant, congratulations, you're a carrier! But don’t be popping champagne just yet; it means you might pass that variant on to your future kids.

### What are the symptoms of familial dysautonomia?

Symptoms usually show up right at birth. We're talking episodes of involuntary nerve impairment, motor and sensory nerve impairment, poor growth, and developmental delays. That's a mouthful! To put it simply, it makes life a bit complicated for those affected.

### Did you know?

Familial dysautonomia is most commonly found in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Knowledge is power, folks!

### Learn more 

The 23andMe **Familial Dysautonomia Carrier Status report** can give you insights into whether you might be a carrier for this condition. It specifically tests for one variant in the ELP1 gene and is geared towards people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Keep in mind, just because you don’t have any variants detected doesn’t mean you’re in the clear—you could still be a carrier for familial dysautonomia. Genetic testing is like a game of hide and seek, and occasionally those sneaky genes like to keep their secrets.
