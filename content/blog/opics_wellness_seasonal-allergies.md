## What are seasonal allergies?

Ah, seasonal allergies! The classic surprise party that nobody wants to attend. Also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, these delightful nuisances occur when your immune system decides that small airborne particles—like pollen or mold—are more dangerous than a dragon invasion. Depending on your location and what tree is throwing a pollen party, you may find yourself sneezing, sporting a runny nose, and scratching your itchy eyes at inopportune times.

Some symptoms to watch out for include:

- Sneezing
- Runny, stuffy, or itchy nose
- Itchy, red, or watery eyes
- Coughing

Do you often feel like you're auditioning for a role in a horror movie when pollen is in the air? You're not alone! People with seasonal allergies may also be more likely to develop asthma. So, take cover!

## Living with seasonal allergies

Living with seasonal allergies can be like living with a stubborn houseguest who always forgets to clean up after themselves. Symptoms can turn even the most basic tasks into a mountain to climb (without the climbing gear, may I add). You might struggle to get a good night’s sleep, leading to daytime fatigue and less-than-stellar focus. But fear not! There are treatments out there, from antihistamines to nasal sprays, that can help keep that pesky immune system in check. If you feel like your allergies are ruining your vibe, consult a healthcare professional and reclaim your time outdoors!

## Is seasonal allergies genetic?

Spoiler alert: genetics do play a role when it comes to seasonal allergies. So, if your Aunt Gertrude has seasonal sniffles every spring, chances are you might experience the same plight. It turns out that if you've got family members with allergies, you're more likely to join the club. Of course, it’s not just one single genetic variant at play; it’s like a team of tiny variants that, together, make your genetic chances of developing seasonal allergies more likely.

23andMe can hook you up with a Seasonal Allergies report that takes into account over 6,500 genetic markers to give you an insight into your genetic predisposition. But, as with all royal bloodlines, let’s not forget that outside factors matter too!

## Other factors that can impact your chances of developing seasonal allergies

Wouldn’t it be nice if genetics were the only factor determining allergies? Unfortunately, it’s like a fable with a twist. Besides genetics, a host of other pesky variables might influence whether you find yourself sneezing at the first hint of spring:

- Family history of allergies
- Certain health conditions (other allergies, eczema, etc.)
- Living or working in an allergen-heavy environment
