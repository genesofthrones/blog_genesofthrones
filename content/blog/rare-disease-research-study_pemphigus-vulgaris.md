You could change the future of pemphigus vulgaris research.  
**Seriously! No pressure or anything.**

## Rare Disease Research Study: Pemphigus Vulgaris

So, let's talk about pemphigus vulgaris. It’s not your fun neighborhood condition; it’s an autoimmune disorder that causes blistering and erosion of the skin and mucous membranes. Yeah, not a party. Despite the rarity (less than 200,000 cases in the U.S.), the need for research and effective treatments is huge. And here’s where you come in!

With the help of **23andMe**, researchers are aiming to understand the genetics behind pemphigus vulgaris to pave the way for new treatments. If you’re feeling a little “I want to make a difference,” this might be your calling.

## Why Participate?

Here’s the deal: if you're living with pemphigus vulgaris, your insights and genetic information can be incredibly valuable. By participating in this study, you could help researchers unlock secrets that might lead to effective treatments. And who wouldn’t want to be part of a groundbreaking research venture? 

## Eligibility

Want to be a part of this transformative journey? Here’s what you need to qualify:

* You’ve been diagnosed with pemphigus vulgaris
* You are 18 years or older
* You reside in the U.S.
* You’re willing to provide a saliva sample (don’t worry; it's not as weird as it sounds!)
* You can manage a couple of online surveys about your experience with the condition

If you don’t meet all the criteria but still want to contribute, you can help spread the word. Share this [flyer](https://permalinks.23andme.com/pdf/PV.pdf) and be a pemphigus vulgaris superhero!

## How Does It Work?

It's really simple! If you're eligible and ready to roll, you’ll receive a **23andMe Health + Ancestry kit** for free (because who doesn’t love free stuff?). Here’s what’s next:

1. **Saliva Sample**: Yup, just a little spit. Easy peasy!
2. **Take Surveys**: Answer some questions about your health and your experience. Think of it as a health-themed quiz night.

And voila! You’re officially part of a research study aiming to shake things up in the autoimmune world.
