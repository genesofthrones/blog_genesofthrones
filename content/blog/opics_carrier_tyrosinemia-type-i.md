## Let's talk about Tyrosinemia Type I & Genetics

**What is Tyrosinemia Type I?**

Ah, Tyrosinemia Type I, the rare genetic disorder that likes to crash parties uninvited! This condition is known for throwing high levels of the amino acid tyrosine into the mix, leading to all sorts of drama like liver and kidney disease. To snag a ticket to this exclusive club, you've got to have two variants in the FAH gene. If you‚Äôve got just one variant, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîyou‚Äôre a carrier, not a member. Think of it as being a carrier of a really boring secret; you might not be affected, but you could pass along that fun tidbit to your future kids!

**The Genetics Behind Tyrosinemia Type I**

So, what‚Äôs the deal with the FAH gene? It‚Äôs the mastermind behind an enzyme that works tirelessly to break down tyrosine. Unfortunately, if variants sneak into the FAH gene, that enzyme decides to take a vacation, resulting in a build-up of tyrosine byproducts. And let me tell you, things can get a bit messy!

**Did You Know?**

Tyrosinemia Type I is most common in individuals of French Canadian, Finnish, Ashkenazi Jewish, European, Norwegian, and Turkish descent. So, if you‚Äôre from these areas and planning to have a kid, it might be worth diving into your genetic background.
