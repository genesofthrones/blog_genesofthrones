## Let's talk about Misophonia & Genetics

**Say what?**  
### Misophonia  
Misophonia is that delightful condition where the sound of someone munching fills you with unbridled rage—like your blood is boiling over and you’re debating whether to compile a list of legal consequences for your chomping neighbor. Yes, it's real, and yes, it can be deeply frustrating.

## How it works

So what exactly causes this overwhelming urge to strangle someone just because they're chewing a piece of gum? While the exact cause of misophonia remains a bit of a mystery, scientists are on the case. They think it might be due to an increased connection between the brain systems responsible for hearing and the “fight or flight” response. You know, that primal instinct that gets triggered when you hear what could be considered a genuine threat—like someone making way too much noise with a bag of chips.

### Did you know?

In a survey of over 80,000 23andMe customers of European descent, a whopping 20 percent reported feeling “filled with rage” at the sound of others chewing. That’s right, folks—you're not alone in your auditory agony!

### The genetic link

Here’s where things get nerdy. 23andMe researchers have pinpointed a specific genetic marker associated with the rage you might experience during mealtime. This marker hangs out near the TENM2 gene, which plays a role in brain development. But don’t get too excited—this genetic marker is just one piece of the puzzle. Non-genetic factors still play a role. So, while your DNA might have it out for you during dinner, your upbringing and environment might also be throwing fuel on that fire.
