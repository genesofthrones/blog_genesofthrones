# Let's talk about Canavan Disease

## What is Canavan disease?

Canavan disease, or as some might call it, "that really rare genetic face-palm," is a neurological doozy. To get technical, it's a genetic disorder characterized by a loss of nerve cell function in the brain that just keeps getting worse over timeâ€”like that one friend who insists theyâ€™re "fine" after drinking too much at a party.

For someone to actually have Canavan disease, they need to inherit two variants in the **ASPA gene**, or two copies of a single variant. A person with just one variant is merely a carrier and wonâ€™t actually experience symptoms. Good news for them; bad news for their future kids if a partner also has a variant.

## Is Canavan disease genetic?

You bet it is! Canavan disease springs from variants in the **ASPA gene**, which encodes an enzyme thatâ€™s supposed to break down a particular compound in our brain called N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA). If those variants disrupt that process, it leads to the unwanted buildup of NAA. Imagine stashing too many snacks in a cupboard until it explodesâ€”that's what happens inside the brain, leading to various symptoms.

## What are the symptoms of Canavan disease?

Symptoms typically rear their ugly heads during infancy. These can include developmental disabilities, a gradual loss of muscle tone, seizures, and swallowing difficulties. Basically, itâ€™s not fun, and definitely not the kind of family trait youâ€™d want to boast about at a reunion.

## Did you know?

Canavan disease is most common in individuals of **Ashkenazi Jewish descent**. How's that for a specialized genealogy fact?

Curious if you might be a carrier? The **[23andMe Canavan Disease Carrier Status report](https://www.23andme.com/topics/carrier/canavan-disease/)** can provide you with the scoop on that. Knowing if you're a carrier means you can make informed decisions about family planning, and hey, that may just save future generations from having to deal with surprises.

The 23andMe process tests for three specific variants in the ASPA gene. But be carefulâ€”if the results say you donâ€™t have any detected variants, that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you arenâ€™t a carrier.
