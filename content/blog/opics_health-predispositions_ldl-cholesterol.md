## Is LDL Cholesterol Genetic? Explore LDL Cholesterol and What Your DNA Can Tell You

LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, often dubbed the "bad" cholesterol, has a knack for sneaking into your bloodstream. It carries cholesterol from your liver to your cells. While cholesterol has its important functions—like building cells and hormones—too much of this LDL fella can lead to some serious health concerns. We wouldn’t want a cholesterol traffic jam in our blood vessels now, would we?

### How LDL Cholesterol Can Impact Your Health

High LDL cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease—basically, all the things we want to avoid. The catch? Many people walk around with high LDL levels and don’t even know it, which is why regular check-ups are essential. It's like having an unexpected surprise party, but instead of balloons, it’s just a bunch of health risks.

### Is High LDL Cholesterol Genetic?

You might wonder if this is something you simply inherited from Aunt Matilda's side of the family. Well, genetics do indeed play a role! There’s a condition called [familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)](https://www.23andme.com/topics/health-predispositions/fh/) that can kickstart high LDL cholesterol levels at a young age. Plus, there are many other genetic variants that can nudge your LDL levels higher, making it worthwhile to check in with your DNA.

And just like your family's knack for holding on to every pair of cut-off jeans, a family history of high cholesterol can also increase your risk of developing it.

### Other Factors That Can Cause An Increased Likelihood of High LDL Cholesterol

Genetics aren’t the only players in this game. Here are some lifestyle choices and factors that can impact your cholesterol levels: 

- Eating a heart-healthy diet (goodbye, greasy fries)
- Regular exercise (remember that thing called your gym membership?)
- Maintaining a healthy weight
- Aging (thanks, time!)
- Pregnancy and certain medications can also increase your risk.

### Did You Know?

About 55% of people in the U.S. will develop high cholesterol by their 70s. Whoa, talk about a statistic that’ll make you raise an eyebrow!

### Please Note

- The LDL Cholesterol report does *not* diagnose high LDL cholesterol and shouldn't be the basis for your medical decisions. 
- Developed with insights gathered from thousands of customers, this report estimates your likelihood of developing high LDL cholesterol based on genetics but doesn’t factor in your lifestyle or family history. 
- And just to keep you on your toes—it not only lacks variants linked to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) but is also not exhaustive of every possible genetic variant affecting your LDL.
