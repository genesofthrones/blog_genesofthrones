# Is Age-Related Macular Degeneration Genetic? Explore AMD and What Your DNA Can Tell You

If you thought your genes only decided your eye color and how many dance moves you have at weddings, think again! Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is knocking at the door, and guess what? Your genetic makeup might just hold the key.

## Types of AMD

First, let’s get some basics down. There are two types of AMD: dry and wet. The dry version is like that slow, creeping fog that makes it hard for you to spot the exit at IKEA. This type accounts for about 90% of AMD cases and is caused by the buildup of yellow fatty deposits under the retina, known as “drusen.” Fun fact: It sounds like a fancy cheese, but you won’t want to taste it.

On the flip side, there's wet AMD—think of it as the party crasher of eye diseases. This version involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels that leak into the macula, making your central vision blurry. It’s like the world’s worst watercolor painting, and can lead to severe vision loss quite rapidly. Not fun at all.

## Is AMD Risk Influenced by Genetics?

Spoiler alert: Yes, indeed! Genetics play a significant role when it comes to AMD. Variants in specific genes, like CFH and ARMS2, are known to be associated with this condition. So, if your great-aunt Sally ended up seeing more blurry than clear in her later years, there’s a chance your DNA might be borrowing some of her traits.

## Other Factors that May Cause an Increased Likelihood of AMD

Now, before you start blaming everything on your DNA, remember there are other factors at play. Age is the biggest culprit here, along with smoking and family history. Interestingly, folks of European descent are more prone to AMD compared to those of African, Hispanic, or Asian descent. But wait, there’s a silver lining! A healthy diet can help reduce your risk. So, more veggies, fewer donuts, got it?

### AMD Affects Many People

Let’s not sugarcoat it: more than 10 million people in the U.S. are dealing with some form of AMD. Yikes!

### Find Out if Your Genetics Might Increase Your Likelihood of Developing AMD

So here's the juicy part. If you're curious about whether your genetics might increase your odds of developing AMD, 23andMe can lend a helpful hand. Their Age-Related Macular Degeneration Genetic Health Risk report* dives into your DNA to see if you may have a higher risk of developing AMD based on those pesky genetic variants. The report includes info on CFH and ARMS2 genes, giving you a clearer (pun intended) picture of your health landscape.

As we navigate this genetic maze together, take note that while the report highlights genetic associations, it’s not a free pass to skip the eye doctor. Remember, your overall risk can be influenced by more than just your genes.

## Final Thoughts

Understanding if AMD runs in your genetic family tree can give you insight into how to better care for your eyesight. With complexities like AMD representing both genetics and lifestyle choices, it’s crucial to stay informed and keep those peepers healthy. 

And who knows, maybe one day someone will discover a magical genetic trait that makes us all immune to blurry vision—until then, it’s vitamins, veggies, and the occasional eye exam!
