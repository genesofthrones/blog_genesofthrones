## Preeclampsia 101: What's the Deal?

Alright, so let’s get this party started with a little knowledge bomb! Preeclampsia is like that uninvited guest at a pregnancy bash who shows up with a foul attitude—persistent high blood pressure and, in some cases, can wreak havoc on organs like the liver and kidneys. The trouble tends to come later in pregnancy and, thankfully, typically gives you your space post-delivery.

Diagnosis is usually a cocktail of high blood pressure readings (we’re talking >140 mmHg systolic and/or >90 mmHg diastolic), some odd lab tests, and possibly other symptoms that sound a lot more dramatic than your average pregnancy discomfort. Monitoring is super crucial, but that’s not quite as fun to talk about as genetics—so let’s get to the juicy stuff!

## The Health Impact: What You Need To Know

Here’s where things get a tad tricky. Symptoms of mild preeclampsia can sometimes sneak past you, masquerading as your typical pregnancy complaints. You know, a little swelling here, a little headache there—it’s all fun and games until someone gets a misunderstanding of severe symptoms! The advanced version can lead to severe headaches, vision changes, and let’s not forget that delightful HELLP syndrome you may have heard about (because who doesn’t want their conditions to come with an acronym?)

If things go south, preeclampsia can hurt baby growth and lead to future health conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease for the parent. So, everyone gets extra love and attention, and in some cases, you might need to make a premature exit from the pregnancy party.

## Is Preeclampsia Genetic?

### Spoiler Alert: Yes!

Genetic factors can play a big role in who’s more likely to throw down with preeclampsia. If your family tree has some branches showing signs of it, guess what? You might wanna pay a bit more attention. A whopping 4% of pregnancies in the U.S. are affected, and if you've got a personal or familial history with this condition, your likelihood might go up even further. 

23andMe throws a genetic party of its own, analyzing about 14,462 genetic markers to give you a heads-up on your risk. Sure, genetics isn’t the only player—there are a few other factors that come into play. And it turns out: not every genetic variant will be your downfall, but they can collectively influence your chances.

### Other Contributors to the Preeclampsia Experience

If you think genetics are a hard enough card to draw, hold onto your hats. Other factors include:

- Previous run-ins with preeclampsia (your chances of getting invited again increase)
- A plethora of health conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, and some autoimmune foes like to party too.
- Type of pregnancy (multiples, IVF, and your first trip to pregnancy town)
- Age (the 35+ crowd has slightly better odds of a meet-up with preeclampsia)
- Being of African/African American descent
- Family history (surprise!)
