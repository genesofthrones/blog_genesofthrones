## Rare Disease Research Study: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Ah, the world of rare diseases! It's kind of like the hidden levels in video games - not everyone knows they're there, but they definitely deserve some attention. One such condition is pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This sneaky little monster has been causing quite a stir due to its rarity and complexity. But don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt have to face it alone. 23andMe is tackling this challenge with their Rare Disease Research Study, and you could play a key role! 

We‚Äôre talking about a disease that can change the lives of those affected, but funding and awareness are about as common as dragons in our beloved "Genes of Thrones" saga. Together, we can change that! Participating in this research could lead to breakthroughs that lead to better treatments and ultimately improve the lives of those living with PAH.

## Our Goal

The motto here is simple: Let's improve lives! The goal of this study? Develop new treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Your participation could literally help those battling this condition, and who wouldn‚Äôt want to be a hero in someone else‚Äôs story?

## Why Your Participation is So Important

PAH affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., making it one of those diseases that often goes unnoticed. By joining this study, you could provide invaluable genetic info and personal insights to unravel its complexities. Think of it as contributing to your own epic tale while also lifting your fellow companions! 

Now, if you don‚Äôt meet the eligibility criteria listed below but still want to help advance the cause, fear not! Simply share the details with others who might be able to join the quest.

## Eligibility

So, who can join this heroic endeavor? If you check the following boxes, you may qualify:

* Diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension
* 18+ years old
* Residing in the U.S.
* Willing to provide a saliva sample for DNA testing
* Ready to complete online surveys about your health experience

## How It Works

Signing up is a breeze ‚Äì no secret tunnels or dragons involved. If eligible, you‚Äôll receive a 23andMe Health + Ancestry kit at no cost. After providing your saliva sample (yes, that is a royal task!), you will then answer questions about your health and experiences. Easy-peasy!

Want a little more excitement? You‚Äôll have access to the [23andMe Health + Ancestry service](https://www.23andme.com/dna-health-ancestry/) along the way. How‚Äôs that for a fanfare?
