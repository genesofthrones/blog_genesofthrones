## Is Parkinson’s Disease Genetic? Explore Parkinson’s Disease and What Your DNA Can Tell You

Parkinson’s disease, a condition known for its fun party trick of shaking and muscle stiffness, typically makes its entrance after the age of 55. About 1-2% of folks out there will find themselves battling this unwelcome visitor at some point. But, let's get to the nitty-gritty: can our beloved genetics take some of the blame?

### Genetics of Parkinson’s Disease Risk

The answer is a resounding *yes*! Genetics plays a significant role in the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. There are certain genetic variants—yes, those pesky differences in our DNA—that are associated with this condition. Two stars of the show are the LRRK2 and GBA genes. While there are other genetic variants out there knocking on the door of Parkinson’s research, those two are the VIPs most studied.

### Other Factors That Might Cause an Increased Likelihood of Parkinson’s Disease

It’s not all about genes, though! Here are other characters that could increase your chances of developing Parkinson’s:

- **Age**: Like fine wine, your risk increases as you grow older. 
- **Sex**: Looks like guys have a higher chance than gals of developing Parkinson’s. 
- **Family History**: If you have a first-degree relative with Parkinson's, consider yourself part of the club with increased risk.
- **Exposure to Chemicals**: Some substances we encounter can raise the stakes.

And a friendly reminder: consult with a healthcare professional before making any major lifestyle changes. Let’s keep our life decisions smart and sassy.
