## Let's talk about Earwax Type & Genetics

Earwax is one of those things most of us probably don‚Äôt spend a lot of time thinking about. That‚Äôs why you might be surprised to learn that there are two different earwax types: dry or wet. Yes, folks, there really is a genetic difference in the gooey stuff lurking in our ears! ü¶ª

### How it works

So, what is earwax, anyway? It has nothing to do with candles or the stuff that bees make. Human earwax is a fatty substance produced by glands that are found deep within the ear canal. Think of it as your ears' natural moisturizer ‚Äî but less glamorous.

### The genetic link

You can thank your ABCC11 gene for your earwax type. This gene plays the role of a bouncer at the cell club, helping to move fat in and out of your cells. 

- If you have 1 or 2 copies of the C variant in the ABCC11 gene, your earwax is wet and sticky (the gooey variety).
- If you've got two copies of the T variant, your earwax is dry, light-colored, and flaky (good luck finding that on your pillow!).

### Did you know?

Earwax plays an important role in keeping our ears bacteria-free. It traps dirt and bacteria, escorting them out of the ear canal when we move our jaws (which is why you might hear that satisfying noise when you chew). It also contains at least 10 compounds that help it prevent bacteria from growing inside your ear. Talk about an unsung hero!
