myasthenia gravis research.

# Rare Disease Research Study: Myasthenia Gravis

If someone told you that you could help change the landscape of a chronic autoimmune disorder while sitting on your couch in sweatpants, would you jump at the chance? Spoiler alert: you totally can! Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a pesky little devil where antibodies wreak havoc on the communication between your nerves and muscles, resulting in some pretty nasty muscle weakness. 

The 23andMe Rare Disease Research Study aims to unravel the genetics of MG, with the hope that better treatments will one day be within our reach. Think of it as a genetic Avengers team — it needs your help to save the day!

It's *OUR* mission to raise awareness and understanding about rare diseases like MG. And who better to help us out than YOU?

## Our Goal

Simple: we want to improve the lives of those battling myasthenia gravis by discovering effective new treatments. But guess what? Your participation is the missing puzzle piece.

### Why Your Participation is So Important

MG is classified as a rare disease, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. That’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack! By participating, you can help shed light on these rare diseases and make a real difference. Your DNA and experiences could lead us to the breakthroughs we've been dreaming of.

## How It Works

Getting involved is as easy as pie — you don't even need to put on pants. If you're eligible, you'll receive a FREE 23andMe Health + Ancestry kit. Just provide a saliva sample, fill out a couple of online surveys about your health, and voilà, you're part of the research army!

## Who We Are

Founded in 2006, 23andMe exists to help people access and understand their genetics. By joining this research, you’ll be contributing your valuable data that could be shared (with your permission) with researchers, advocacy organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, all in the hope of fighting MG and other rare diseases.

### FAQs and Resources

**Is this legit?**
Absolutely! You'd be joining a well-established research platform with a solid track record. 

**What if I'm not eligible?**
You can still be a superstar by spreading the word in the MG community using our [flyer](https://permalinks.23andme.com/pdf/MG.pdf).

If you're like our protagonist from House Helix, who discovers a hidden genetic trait that could change everything, participating in this study may just unlock your own potential — and who knows, maybe even the fate of the kingdom!

Think of it like this: if you have the genetic prowess to aid in fighting a relentless disease while enjoying a bit of couch time, wouldn’t you want to wield that power? Together, as defenders of health and knowledge, we can uncover the mysteries of our genetic make-up and unlock some serious advancements in medicine.
