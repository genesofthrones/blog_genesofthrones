## Baby Soft Newborn Hair & Genetics

Some babies greet the world with a luxurious mane, while others come in looking like they've just emerged from a style drought. So, what's up with the varying amounts of hair? Spoiler alert: Genetics is behind this hair-raising mystery!

## How it works

Did you know that babies are born with all the hair follicles they'll ever need? Yup, that's right! On average, we humans start our journey with about five million hair follicles, just waiting for their moment in the spotlight. Around week 10 of pregnancy, these little guys spring into action, sprouting tiny strands of hair called lanugo. By the time week 20 rolls around, your baby’s scalp is already rocking some baby hair.

Here's the kicker: that luscious lanugo isn't the fluffy stuff we all adore—it's usually shed in the uterus between 24-28 weeks. So, any hair that makes a debut at birth likely started sprouting during the last trimester. No pressure, right?

### The genetic link

While everyone has different amounts of hair, genetics decides how much hair you might pop out with. A cool fact from [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/topics/traits/newborn-hair/) is that they look at 26 specific places in your DNA that tell the story of newborn hair. Even complexion plays a role: babies with darker skin often come with more hair than their lighter counterparts. So, the next time someone asks about your hairline, just say, "It’s in my genes!"

## Did you know?

There’s an old wives’ tale linking heartburn during pregnancy to a baby's hair. The belief? More heartburn equals more hair. In 2006, some curious researchers decided to put this theory to the test. The result? Women who dealt with moderate to severe heartburn were indeed more likely to have babies rocking thick locks at birth. Talk about a spicy twist!
