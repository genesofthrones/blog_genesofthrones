# Let's talk about A Family Tree

Have you ever wondered if you have relatives you didn’t know existed, or how you're related to that third cousin in Ohio? Family trees can help you get to the root of your questions—Pun definitely intended!

## What is a family tree?

A family tree is like a genealogy chart that visually illustrates how individuals are connected within a family. It starts with the oldest generations at the top and branches down to the younger generations, much like those awkward conversations about your family at Thanksgiving where your uncle insists on explaining how everyone is related.

### How is a family tree used?

Family trees are a handy way to visualize relationships, keep a record of your ancestry, and most importantly—discover relatives you might not have known existed. Maybe you're a long-lost sibling away from learning that you're royalty in another kingdom—or you just have another distant cousin who also unlocks the mystery of why you both can't seem to dance.

### What does 23andMe’s Family Tree do?

Many people find it daunting to start creating a family tree from scratch, almost as daunting as choosing a movie for family movie night. That’s where 23andMe steps in to save the day! They automatically generate a family tree for you, which includes a visualization of your genetic relatives who have opted into their DNA Relatives feature. This means you'll get to see how these other 23andMe customers may be related to you, possibly answering that burning question about whether you're actually related to the new King of Genoria.

### What else can I do with my 23andMe Family Tree?

Once you've got your family tree, the fun doesn't stop there! You can add notes (hello, *great uncle twice removed*), important dates, and even photos to better document your lineage. They are planning to roll out more features where you can edit relationships and even share your tree with others—perfect for when you're ready to take on the role of family historian. And don't forget: you can get your relatives involved; they can help you add even more juicy details to your family story by using a 23andMe service.

So, if you're ready to uncover the nuances of your ancestry, dive into your very own family tree generated by 23andMe with one of their DNA testing services. Who knows, you might just discover that you’re not just from House Helix, but that there’s a whole lineage of genetically gifted ancestors waiting to be discovered!
