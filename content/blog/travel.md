# Travel the World Based on Your DNA

Ever thought about traveling the world with a road map that’s as unique as your genetic code? Well, thanks to the wonders of DNA testing, you can now explore your ancestral roots and create a travel itinerary that’ll have you sipping espresso in Italy and nibbling on burek in Bosnia—all while knowing your exact percentage of, well, everything! 

## Unlock the Secrets of Your DNA

With **23andMe**, you can dive into your ancestry and see where your genetic makeup might take you on your next adventure. Imagine peeking into your DNA and learning you have an ancient lineage that traces back to North Africa, while your buddy is just 95% Julian from North Dakota (no offense to Julains)!

### Customize Your DNA Journey

So how does this work? With a breakdown of your ancestry, 23andMe makes it simple to find out your global roots. Here's a fictional example of what you might find:

| Ancestry Breakdown | DNA Itinerary              |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 11.0% North African & Arabian | Casablanca, Morocco   |
| 30.4% Italian       | Rome, Italy                |
| 15.4% Iberian       | Lisbon, Portugal           |
| 5.9% Ashkenazi Jewish | Kraków, Poland           |

Who knew your great-great-grandma was such a globe-trotter? And who doesn’t want to eat pasta in Rome while having a renaissance moment? 

### DNA Timeline: A Trip Through Time

Not only does 23andMe give you your makeup, but it crafts a timeline showing where your ancestors lived over the last 500 years. Now you can put on your best historian hat and sound super smart at cocktail parties!

### Meet Your DNA Relatives

Ever get the feeling you really vibe with someone? Turns out they could be family! The **DNA Relatives** feature allows you to connect with long-lost relatives worldwide. So if you found out you have a relative in Sicily who can hook you up with homemade cannoli recipes, you just might have to start packing!

## Real Stories, Real Travel Adventures

Many customers are taking their genetics seriously and booking trips based on their ancestry! For instance, meet **Dimitri**. The guy found out he was 69% Balkan and decided to take his daughters on a memorable Greek vacation. Now, they love Greece so much they’re going back every two years. Talk about a new family tradition! 

On the flip side, you’ve got Robin, who after getting her family’s DNA results, turned a holiday gift into a full-blown globetrotting adventure. Christmas presents got real! 

**Rachel** embarked on a journey to discover her Norwegian roots and ended up walking the streets where her ancestors once lived. Someone get this gal a Viking helmet and a photo op!
