# Is Gestational Diabetes Genetic? Explore Gestational Diabetes and what your DNA can tell you

Gestational diabetes mellitus, or as I like to call it, the pregnancy surprise party nobody ordered, is a form of diabetes that rears its head during pregnancy. That’s right! When you're busy trying to find the perfect diaper bag and binge-watching your favorite baby shows, your body might host some hormonal shenanigans that impact its ability to keep blood sugar levels in check. After the baby arrives (and you’ve had a solid nap), things usually go back to normal. But for some, those sugar levels can go up to a level that’s not only risky for them but also for the little one cooking away.

## How can gestational diabetes impact you and your child?

The catch with gestational diabetes is that many people won't know they have it, since symptoms can be as elusive as your child's missing sock. But if left unchecked, high blood sugar can lead to some not-so-fun complications: larger babies (hello, potential complicated delivery), increased chances of high blood pressure, and even long-term risks for type 2 diabetes for both you and your child. Gulp!

## But Wait, There’s More: Other Factors of Gestational Diabetes

Gestational diabetes isn't just about genetics and all that jazz. Here are a few added ingredients to the mix:

- Personal history of gestational diabetes or prediabetes
- Family history of gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes (thanks, great-aunt Edna!)
- Age - yes, as you age, your chances of experiencing this condition may increase
- Ethnicity - certain groups may have a higher risk (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, Indigenous Americans, and Pacific Islanders).

So if your family gatherings tend to include discussions on health concerns, it may be worth paying attention!

### Important Things to Remember

- This report isn’t a doctor in a lab coat diagnosing you; it’s an estimate based on genetics, not a crystal ball.
- Only available to 23andMe+ members who report their birth sex as female. Sorry fellas!
- The report was built from contributions by thousands of participants and helps in estimating your risk—but hey, no crystal ball can account for everything. It’s a puzzle piece, not the whole picture.
